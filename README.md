## Last-Chapter-Basic-Python

### Use Case
#### Objective Statement :

1. Get the insight about Function in Python
2. Get the insight abous Class, Object, and Static method.
3. Get the insight about txt file in Python
4. To gain new knowledge about Pydoc
5. To gain new knowledge about io
6. Get the insight about class, object, and method in the Python
7. Get the new insight about built-in module in Python

#### Challenges :
1. Python is a case sensitive programming language, so the writing of the syntax must be considered
2. A lot of new things about python will be learned here, so it needs a detailed and easy to understand explanation

#### Expected Outcome :
1. Knowing how to define, call, and return Function in Python
2. Understand about argumen and parameter in the Python Function
3. Knowing the different between class and static method.
4. Knowing how to open, read, close, and delete the txt files in the Python
5. Knowing more about pydoc and io
6. Knowing the aplication of os path and unit test
7. Understanding class, object, and method in Python
8. Knowing more about built-in module, math, datetime, random, sys, and os, in the Python

#### Benefits :
1. As a basic material for learning Python language for beginners
2. As additional knowledge about function, txt file, pydoc, io, os path, unit test, python - class, object, and method, and built-in module in python

### Outlines

#### Function - Definition, Call, and Return
1. Function in python can organize codes and have 1 specific role and can be re-use.
2. Return and not return function in python (re-use or single use).
3. Handle value results and return results in function.
4. Local and global variable in function when pass by reference (referencing data changed inside or outside function).
#### Function - Argument and Parameter
1. The keyword argument function to naming of parameter with explicitly mentioned.
2. The positional argument function to use for iterable variable.
3. Parameter function order to see the order of the function.
4. Anonymous function to get to know about lambda function.
#### Pydoc
1. The pydoc module automatically generates documentation from Python modules.
2. The pydoc module comes packaged along with Python.
#### Open, Read, Close, and Delete Txt File
1. The open() function has many parameters but be focusing on the first two
2. Read text from the text file using the file read(), readline(), or readlines() method of the file object.
3. The close() method used to close the file that is no longer in use.
4. os.remove() method in Python is used to remove or delete a file.
#### io
1. Python io module allows us to manage the file-related input and output operations.
2. This module is quite useful to perform file-related I/O operations.
#### os path
1. os module in Python provides functions for interacting with the operating system.
2. os.path module is sub module of OS module in Python used for common path name manipulation.
#### Unit test
1. The unittest module provides a rich set of tools for constructing and running tests.
2. The unittest unit testing framework was originally inspired by unit and has a similar flavor as major unit testing frameworks in other languages.
#### Python - Class, Object, and Static Method
Class, Object and Static Method is different each other but can have a similar results. 
#### Python Math Module
1. Python math module is a standard module in Python that used to deal with mathematical operations
2. Math module provides the value of various constants and functions to deal with both basic operations
#### Python Random Module
Python Random module is a built-in module of Python which is used to generate random numbers
#### Python Datetime Module
1. The datetime module provides classes for manipulating dates and times
2. The classes in datetime module provide a number of functions to deal with dates, times and time intervals
#### Python os Module
1. The os module in Python provides functions for interacting with the operating system
2. One of the methods in os module is os.mkdir() to create a directory in the python
#### Python sys Module
1. The sys module in Python provides various functions and variables that are used to manipulate different parts of the Python runtime environment
2. One of the functions in the sys module that is often used to handling exceptions is exc_info
